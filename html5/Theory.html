   <h2>Q1: What are the new tags added in HTML5?</h2> 
   Ans: <br> <b> HTML5 Tags:</b>
   <p>HTML5 introduced several new tags to improve semantics and provide more structure to web documents. Some of the key new tags added in HTML5 include:
   <br><p>1.<b> header tag</b>: Represents introductory content, typically containing navigation links, logos, and headings.</p>
   <br><p>2.<b> footer tag</b>: Defines the footer of a section or a page, usually containing copyright information, contact details, or other metadata..</p>
   <br><p>3.<b> nav tag</b>: Specifies a section of navigation links, such as menus or navigation bars..</p>
   <br><p>4.<b> article  tag</b>: Represents an independent piece of content that makes sense on its own, such as blog posts, news articles, or forum posts.</p>
   <br><p>5.<b> section tag</b>: Defines a generic section of a document, often used to group related content together.</p>
   <br><p>6.<b> aside tag</b>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it, such as sidebars or pull quotes..</p>
   <br><p>7.<b> main tag</b>:Specifies the main content of a document, excluding any header, footer, or sidebar content..</p>
   <br><p>8.<b> figure and figcaption tag</b>: Used together to represent self-contained content, such as images, videos, diagrams, or code snippets, along with a caption..</p>
   <br><p>9.<b> datalist tag</b>: Provides a list of predefined options for input controls like input or  textarea.</p>
   <br><p>10.<b> progress tag</b>:  Represents the progress of a task, such as a file download or form submission.</p>
   <br><p>11.<b> meter tag</b>: Represents a scalar measurement within a known range, such as disk usage, ratings, or voting results.</p>
   <br><p>12.<b> details and summary tag</b>:Used together to create a collapsible section that can be toggled open or closed, useful for hiding secondary information until it's needed.</p>

   <h2>Q2: How to embed audio and video in a webpage?</h2> 
   Ans: <br> <b> To embed audio and video in a webpage, HTML5 provides the audio and video tags. Here's how you can use them::</b>
   <p>
    <audio controls>
    <source src="audio-file.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
  </audio>
<br>
  The audio tag is used to embed audio content.
    The controls attribute adds standard audio controls (play, pause, volume) to the audio player.
    The source  tag is used to specify multiple sources for the audio, allowing the browser to choose the most suitable format based on its capabilities. You can provide different formats like MP3, OGG, or WAV.
    The src attribute specifies the URL of the audio file.
    The type attribute specifies the MIME type of the audio file.
  </p>

  <p>
    <video controls width="640" height="360">
        <source src="video-file.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support the video element.
      </video>
<br>
The  video tag is used to embed video content.
    The controls attribute adds standard video controls (play, pause, volume, fullscreen) to the video player.
    The width and height attributes specify the dimensions of the video player.
    Similar to audio, you can use multiple source tags to provide different video formats for compatibility across browsers and devices.
    The src attribute specifies the URL of the video file.
    The type attribute specifies the MIME type of the video file.
  </p>

  <h2>Q3: Semantic element in HTML5?</h2> 
  <p>Semantic elements convey the meaning of the content they contain, rather than just describing how the content should be presented. Some of the key semantic elements in HTML5 include:</p>
  <br><p>1.<b> header tag</b>: Represents introductory content, typically containing navigation links, logos, and headings.</p>
  <br><p>2.<b> footer tag</b>: Defines the footer of a section or a page, usually containing copyright information, contact details, or other metadata..</p>
  <br><p>3.<b> nav tag</b>: Specifies a section of navigation links, such as menus or navigation bars..</p>
  <br><p>4.<b> article  tag</b>: Represents an independent piece of content that makes sense on its own, such as blog posts, news articles, or forum posts.</p>
   <br><p>5.<b> section tag</b>: Defines a generic section of a document, often used to group related content together.</p>
   <br><p>6.<b> aside tag</b>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it, such as sidebars or pull quotes..</p>
   <br><p>7.<b> main tag</b>:Specifies the main content of a document, excluding any header, footer, or sidebar content..</p>
   <br><p>8.<b> figure and figcaption tag</b>: Used together to represent self-contained content, such as images, videos, diagrams, or code snippets, along with a caption..</p>
    <br><p>9.<b>time tag</b>: Specifies a specific time or duration, often used to mark up dates, times, or events.</p>
   <br><p>10.<b> details and summary</b>: Used together to create a collapsible section that can be toggled open or closed, useful for hiding secondary information until it's needed.</p>

   <h2>Q4:Canvas and SVG tags</h2>
   <p>1.<b>Canvas:</b></p>
   <p>canvas is an HTML5 element that provides a drawing space for graphics using JavaScript.<br>
    It's essentially a bitmap-based drawing surface where you can dynamically create and manipulate graphics, animations, and interactive elements.<br>
    Canvas graphics are rendered pixel by pixel, making it suitable for complex, dynamic visualizations and games.<br>
    Canvas does not retain the shapes drawn on it, so if you want to interact with the individual elements later, you have to manage that manually in JavaScript.<br>
    Example use cases include real-time data visualization, gaming, photo editing applications, and more.</p>

    <p>2.<b>SVG:</b></p>
   <p>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, which is an XML-based language for describing 2D graphics.<br>
    Unlike Canvas, SVG is resolution-independent, meaning graphics can be scaled without losing quality.<br>
    SVG graphics are composed of shapes and paths defined by mathematical equations, making them suitable for static or less interactive graphics.<br>
    SVG elements can be styled and animated using CSS and JavaScript.<br>
    Because SVG elements are retained in the DOM, they can be easily manipulated, animated, and interacted with using JavaScript or CSS.<br>
    Example use cases include logos, icons, charts, diagrams, and illustrations..</p>
